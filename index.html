	Despite local and federal efforts to help stem hunger, the Bronx remains disproportionately affected by food insecurity compared to other boroughs, according to a <a href="https://hfa-website.cdn.prismic.io/hfa-website/1f5f3896-876a-42f2-bf7e-2fa9303bc877_2021+NY+Hunger+Report_Final.pdf">2021 report</a>. 
</p>

<p>
	As federally funded food assistance programs such as Grab-and-Go and GetFoodNYC, which helped alleviate food insecurity during the pandemic, <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/8/31/22651381/nycs-getfood-free-meal-delivery-service-to-end-this-fall">came to an end</a>, Bronx residents continue to face challenges accessing consistent sources of food. 

<p>
	Charles Platkin, executive director of Hunter College New York City Food Policy Center, expects this trend to persist until long-term solutions, like electronic voucher systems, are implemented in earnest. Even though local charitable efforts such as community fridges and food pantries are helpful, they fail to combat food insecurity in a sustainable way, he said.

<p>
	“They're all nice ideas, and they're all thoughtful and kind and helpful in some ways, but they're not solving and moving the needle on food insecurity,” said Platkin. “No one should have to think about where their next meal is coming from. And that meal needs to be a healthy and nutritious meal. It's a basic human right.”
